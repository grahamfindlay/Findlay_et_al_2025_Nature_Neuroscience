Code for Findlay et al., 2025, Nature Neuroscience.

- To reproduce all figures, see `notebooks/figures/`.
- To reproduce all statistical tables and supplements, see `r/`. 
- To reproduce all reduced parquet dataframes that input to statiscal analysis and plotting, see `notebooks/data_export`. 
- To reproduce analyses from raw data, see `notebooks/pipeline/pipeline.ipynb` to get started.

Most recently tested with Python 3.13.2. I suggest installation and environment management using `uv`. 

See also [`ecephys`](https://github.com/CSC-UW/ecephys), the primary dependency, which provides most core functions. 

Thank you!
