\title{Create contrast matrix for three-way interaction simple slopes}
\usage{
make_three_way_contrasts(model, primary_var, secondary_var, tertiary_var)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object (typically from lme4) containing the
three-way interaction terms}

\item{primary_var}{Character string specifying the name of the primary
variable (the variable whose simple slopes are being tested)}

\item{secondary_var}{Character string specifying the name of the secondary
moderator variable}

\item{tertiary_var}{Character string specifying the name of the tertiary
moderator variable}
}
\value{
A contrast matrix (k) with rows corresponding to combinations of
levels of the secondary and tertiary variables, and columns corresponding
to model coefficients. Each row represents the linear combination of
coefficients needed to test the simple slope of the primary variable at
that combination of moderator levels. Rows with missing interaction terms
are excluded with warnings.
}
\description{
This function generates a contrast matrix for testing simple slopes of a
primary variable at different combinations of levels of secondary and
tertiary variables in the context of a three-way interaction.
