\title{Test individual two-way interactions in a three-way interaction model}
\usage{
test_two_ways(
  full_minus_pst,
  primary_covariate_,
  secondary_covariate_,
  tertiary_covariate_,
  response_var_,
  random_intercept_
)
}
\arguments{
\item{full_minus_pst}{A fitted model object containing the full three-way
interaction (but already excluding the three-way interaction term)}

\item{primary_covariate_}{Character string specifying the primary covariate
name}

\item{secondary_covariate_}{Character string specifying the secondary
covariate name}

\item{tertiary_covariate_}{Character string specifying the tertiary
covariate name}

\item{response_var_}{Character string specifying the response variable name}

\item{random_intercept_}{Character string specifying the random intercept
term (e.g., "(1|subject)")}
}
\value{
A list containing three elements (minus_pt, minus_st, minus_ps),
each containing the reduced model formula, fitted model object, ANOVA
comparison, and p-value for testing the significance of the removed
two-way interaction.
minus_pt = primary:tertiary removed.
minus_st = secondary:tertiary removed.
minus_ps = primary:secondary removed.
}
\description{
This function tests the significance of individual two-way interactions by
comparing a full three-way interaction model against reduced models that
exclude specific two-way interaction terms. It performs likelihood ratio
tests for three comparisons: removing primary-tertiary, secondary-tertiary,
and primary-secondary interactions.
