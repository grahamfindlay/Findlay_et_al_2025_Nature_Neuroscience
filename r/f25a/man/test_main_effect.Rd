test_main_effect(dat, models, contrast_matrix = NULL)
}

\item{dat}{Data frame}

\item{models}{List of nested models (full, reduced, null)}

\item{contrast_matrix}{Optional contrast matrix for post-hoc tests}
}
\value{
List with main effect test results
}
\description{
If the main effect is significant and a contrast matrix is provided,
this function performs optional post hoc tests.
This function does nothing to stop you from testing for a main effect
when such a test is incoherent (e.g., when a significant interaction
exists). That's on you.
