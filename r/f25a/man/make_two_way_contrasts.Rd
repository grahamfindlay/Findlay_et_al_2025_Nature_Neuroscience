\title{Create contrast matrix for two-way interaction simple slopes}
\usage{
make_two_way_contrasts(model, primary_var, secondary_var)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object (typically from lme4) containing the
interaction terms}

\item{primary_var}{Character string specifying the name of the primary
variable (the variable whose simple slopes are being tested)}

\item{secondary_var}{Character string specifying the name of the secondary
variable (the moderator variable)}
}
\value{
A contrast matrix (k) with rows corresponding to levels of the
secondary variable and columns corresponding to model coefficients. Each
row represents the linear combination of coefficients needed to test the
simple slope of the primary variable at that level of the secondary
variable.
}
\description{
This function generates a contrast matrix for testing simple slopes of a
primary variable at different levels of a secondary variable in the context
of a two-way interaction.
